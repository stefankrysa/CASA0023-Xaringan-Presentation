  abstract = {Natural and anthropogenic disasters can cause significant damage to urban infrastructure, landscape, and loss of human life. Satellite based remote sensing plays a key role in rapid damage assessment, post-disaster reconnaissance and recovery. In this study, we aim to assess the performance of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for building damage assessment in Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, due to the ongoing war with Russia. For damage assessment, we employ a simple and robust SAR log ratio of intensity for the Sentinel-1, and a texture analysis for the Sentinel-2. To suppress changes from other features and landcover types not related to urban areas, we construct a mask of the built-up area using the OpenStreetMap building footprints and World Settlement Footprint (WSF), respectively. As it is difficult to get ground truth data in the ongoing war zone, a qualitative accuracy assessment with the very high-resolution optical images and a quantitative assessment with the United Nations Satellite Center (UNOSAT) damage assessment map was conducted. The results indicated that the damaged buildings are mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the study area, wherein Irpin, and the neighboring towns of Bucha and Hostomel are located. The detected building damages show a good match with the reference WorldView images. Compared with the damage assessment map by UNOSAT, 58\% of the damaged buildings were correctly classified. The results of this study highlight the potential offered by publicly available medium resolution satellite imagery for rapid mapping damage to provide initial reference data immediately after a disaster.},

  abstract = {Accurate surface water detection and mapping using Remote Sensing (RS) imagery is crucial for effective water and flood management and for supporting natural ecosystems and human development. In recent years, RS technology and satellite image processing have significantly advanced in flood and permanent water extraction, particularly in water index, clustering, classification, and sub-pixel analysis. Water-index-based techniques, distinguished by their quickness and convenience, offer notable advantages. The dynamic and extensive nature of surface water and flooded areas make the water index particularly effective for monitoring large areas. However, challenges arise due to the complexity of ground surfaces in aquatic environments, including shadows in built-up, vegetated, and mountainous regions, narrow water bodies, and muddy water. This research presents a new Flood Mapping Index using Sentinel-2 imagery (SFMI) designed to address these challenges and identify water and flooded areas more accurately. The SFMI utilizes visible and near-infrared bands derived from Sentinel-2 data, employing 10-m bands to compensate for errors arising from spectral and spatial changes more effectively. The SFMI index is designed based on the spectral signatures of various land cover classes, utilizing the potential of 10-m resolution bands to identify water bodies and flood areas. Unlike the most conventional methods, the SFMI identifies and extracts water and flood regions without complex thresholding, and thus mitigates the impact of irrelevant features, such as dense vegetation and rugged topography on the flood and water body maps. The proposed index was tested in two large areas with high spectral diversity, yielding promising results. The SFMI index demonstrates an average overall accuracy of 97.1\% for pre-flood water extraction, 97.95\% for post-flood water extraction, and 98\% for flooded area extraction. Moreover, the results showed an average kappa coefficient of 0.958 for pre-flood water extraction, 0.965 for post-flood water extraction, and 0.978 for flooded area extraction. The performance of the SFMI index for extracting flooded areas (Î”SFMI) is superior to its performance for water extraction both before and after the flood. However, it is essential to note that the accuracy of the flooded area map is contingent on the accuracy of the water area map both before and after the flood. Thus, the SFMI index based on 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery accurately detects floods and water bodies over time, without relying on thresholding, making it suitable for flood management and monitoring various water bodies like dams, lakes, wetlands, and rivers. The findings underscore the applicability of the proposed SFMI index in diverse and spectrally rich areas, demonstrating its effectiveness in monitoring various surface water bodies, detecting floods, and managing flood crises.},
